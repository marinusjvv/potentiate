This project was created in order to complete a technical test
for Potentiate. The test details can be found in Test_details.md

You can clone it using the following command: 

git clone git@github.com:marinusjvv/potentiate.git

You will then have to run the following command in the project's
main folder, in order to download it's dependancies:

composer install

This project was made to be as simple to set up as possible; I
did not use a database as that would require further configuration,
and we are only using a small, fixed amount of data with no need to
add/edit/update/delete.
