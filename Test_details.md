Create a PHP webpage that solves the following problem.

A company sells hundreds of products on-line and people place orders from all over the world, just like eBay. Each item has a different weight and price.
Each order can be any combination of a different number of items. 
Each of the items purchased are to be grouped into different packages (or parcels) and sent to the courier company for delivery.
The packages (and the items within each package) must meet the following rules:
1.  The total value in dollars for each package cannot be greater than $250
2.  The weight of each package should be as even (or distributed) as possible.
3.  Because of the above requirement, the courier charge should be as low as possible.

Your solution will have:
1.  A simple vertical list of items (in the format Name - price - weight), with a check box next to items
2.  A button saying "Place order"   
3.  When the user clicks on "Place order", the selected items should be submitted to the same page and the above rules should be applied to divide this particular order into multiple packages, and display the output result on the same page.
Below is a sample output on how it should look like:
 
This order has following packages:
Package 1 
Items - Item 1, Item 3, item 7
Total weight - 510g
Total price - $240  
Courier price - $15
 
Package 2 
Items - Item 4, Item 6, item 2
Total weight - 530g
Total price - $160
Courier price - $15
 
Note: Items and courier prices are in the Test_info.xls attached. We will be evaluating your code quality specifically comments (where required), formatting, naming conventions, size of functions, etc.
